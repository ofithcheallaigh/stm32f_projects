# Functions

In C, executable statements can be written inside a function.

A C function is nothing more than a collection of statements which preform a specific task.

Every C program will have at least 1 function - the `main` function. 

Using functions bring modularity to your code, also makes it easy to debug, modify, and increase the maintainability of the code.

Using C functions also minimises code size and reduces redundancy.

Functions provide abstraction. For example, `printf` is a function given by a standard library code.
